piternewbot  — A Telegram bot for legal, high-quality video downloads 

Bring your favorite videos straight into Telegram — responsibly. piternewbot helps users download their own content or content they’re licensed to use from supported platforms, after they subscribe to your channel. It’s fast, clean, and creator-friendly.

✨ Highlights

Subscription-gated access: Users must join your Telegram channel before downloads unlock.
Up to quality: Fetch the best available resolution (when provided by the source).
Multi-platform support: Works with popular sites that allow downloading or provide direct media links (no DRM bypass, no paywall dodging).
Smart UX in chat: Paste a link → pick quality → get the file or a direct file stream.
Queue & rate limits: Keeps things snappy without hammering upstream services.
Admin controls: Whitelist/blacklist, per-user limits, and configurable channel checks.
Privacy-aware: Minimal logging; no analytics by default.
Docker-ready & cloud-friendly: Easy to deploy on your VPS or PaaS.

🧠 How it works (at a glance)

1. Link & intent— User sends a video URL in DM with the bot.
2. Membership check — Bot verifies the user is subscribed to your specified channel.
3. Metadata & options — Bot inspects the URL and returns available qualities (up to if offered).
4. Delivery— On user selection, the bot downloads and sends the file (or streams it) back in Telegram.
5. Fair-use guardrails — If the source is DRM-protected or disallows downloading, the bot politely declines.

✅ Use cases

Creators retrieving their own posted videos in full quality.
Teams managing licensed assets for social republishing.
Community channels offering authorized downloads of public-domain or CC media.

🔐 Respecting rights & platforms

This project is designed for awful use only. It does not circumvent DRM, paywalls, or technical protection measures, and it will refuse sources that prohibit downloading. Always ensure you own the rights or have explicit permission to download and redistribute media.

 📦 Features you’ll love (for maintainers)

Extensible extractors: Add or disable site handlers based on your compliance policy.
Pluggable storage: Local disk by default; swap in S3-compatible backends if needed.
Configuration via env: Channel ID, per-user limits, size caps, and timeouts.
Observability: Structured logs and optional webhook alerts for failures and spikes.

🚀 Roadmap

❓FAQ

Does it download from every site on Earth?
No. It supports popular platforms that permit downloading or provide direct media. DRM-protected or disallowed sources are skipped.

Can it always get 4K?
Only if the source offers and downloading is allowed. Otherwise, it returns the best legal quality available.

Why require a channel subscription?
It’s a clean way to build community, reduce abuse, and keep the bot sustainable.

If you need, I can adapt this into a full README with shields, screenshots/GIFs, and a polished “Quick Start” (without placeholders) — just say the word, and I’ll include concrete env names and example configs.
